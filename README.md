The application  features a interactive & sticky navigation bar. With added on hover events throughout to increase interaction and readability. 

The application includes a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to disallow any content inline or from untrusted remote sources. 

Additionally, a dark mode that persists user color schema choices is included:
